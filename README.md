# real-time_people_tracking_DeepSORT
Real-time people tracking with DeepSORT, and COCO-pretrained YOLOv3 model as detector
### Environment

- python==3.6.5
- tensorflow==1.12.0
- opencv-python


### Getting Started

1. Download the [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)'s .weights files and convert into .ckpt files. ([How to convert?](https://github.com/Nebula4869/real-time_object_detection_YOLOv3))
2. place .ckpt files in the "yolov3_model" folder.
3. Run "realtime_tracking.py" to detect from video or camera.
